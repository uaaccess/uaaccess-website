Hello, and welcome to the UA Access project!

Discover an accessible, seamless way to interact with your Apollo audio interface.

# What is it?

UAAccess is a powerful alternative frontend to the popular [Apollo](https://www.uaudio.com/blog/apollo-faq/) high resolution audio interface from Universal audio.

It's a thoughtfully designed application that ensures the most important features of the Apollo Console software can be used seamlessly with a screen reader.

# But Why?

Apollo is the go-to interface for  audio engineers everywhere, thanks to it's unmatched clarity, depth, and quality. The onboard realtime digital signal processing brings about low latency, while the hardware enables studio quality results across a wide variety of environments.

There's just one problem... accessibility. Until UAAccess, anyone who wanted the best in mixing and mastering hardware but happened to be blind was out of luck.

Imagine dropping thousands of dollars in hard earned money on a product you thought would elevate your workflow, just to find out that you couldn't use it at all? That was us. We're a team of blind and visually impaired technologists who did that, we just didn't feel like taking it back.

# Key Features

* Full compatibility with today's most popular screen readers: JAWS, NVDA, and Voiceover.
* It's cross-Platform. UAAccess works on MacOS and Windows, and doesn't care what DAW or environment you use.
* Intuitive design for quick and efficient navigation.
* Realtime announcements when hardware changes are detected.
* Configure sends, preamps, inputs, outputs, and AUX channels.
* Under active development, with plans for much more.
