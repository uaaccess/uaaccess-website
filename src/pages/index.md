Hello, and welcome to the UAAccess project!

Discover an accessible, seamless way to interact with your Apollo audio interface.

# What is it?

UAAccess is a powerful alternative frontend to the Universal Audio Console software that ensures the most essential features of the Apollo line of audio interfaces are seamlessly accessible with a screen reader.

# But Why?

[Universal Audio](https://www.uaudio.com/) is among the industry leaders in Thunderbolt audio interfaces and analog recording hardware, renowned for its high-quality UAD audio plug-ins and meticulous software emulations of legendary hardware units, including the Neve 1073 and Avalon VT-737 microphone preamplifiers. Apollo is the go-to interface for top artists and producers across the globe, thanks to its elite-class 24-bit / 192 kHz audio conversion and unmatched clarity, depth, and quality. The onboard real-time digital signal processing and Unison™ preamps bring timeless sound and legendary UA craftsmanship right to your studio.

There's just one problem: accessibility. Before UAAccess, blind users who wanted access to Universal Audio's recording and mixing hardware ecosystem were limited to solutions that either offered minimal screen reader support or required additional hardware purchases. Unfortunately, repeated attempts to receive support from Universal Audio to address these shortcomings have been unsuccessful.

Imagine investing thousands of hard-earned dollars into a product you believed would elevate your workflow, only to discover you couldn't use it at all. That was us. We're a team of blind and visually impaired technologists who faced this exact challenge but refused to give up on our craft and ambitions. We weren't willing to forfeit the opportunity to utilize industry-standard hardware simply because of accessibility barriers.
