# Who are we?

We are a group of blind professionals who believe, among other things, that cognitive and physical impairment shouldn't be the obstacle that stands in the way of high quality music production.

We came together when our resident audio engineer, Dan Gililov, pointed out that he was entirely unable to use the Apollo interface and was told by the product team that "accessibility was a feature" they were not willing to add. That just didn't sit well with us.

## Ethin Probst

Ethin is a software engineer interested in low-level code and embedded systems. He holds a BS in computer science from Minot State University.

> I got involved in the UAAccess project when Dan told me how inaccessible the software was. Accessibility and equality has always been very important to me, and I have always strived to push accessibility into as many domains as I can manage. When both Dan and I determined that existing solutions to bridge the gap between the console software and associated tools were insufficient, we set out to fill that gap with what was necessary.
