    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are a group of blind professionals who believe, among other things, that cognitive and physical impairment shouldn't be an obstacle that stands in the way of high quality music production.</p>
<p>We came together when our resident audio engineer, Dan Gililov, pointed out that he was entirely unable to use the Apollo interface and was told by the product team that "accessibility was a feature" they were not willing to add. That just didn't sit well with us.</p>
<h3>Ethin Probst</h3>
<p>Ethin is a software engineer interested in low-level code and embedded systems. He holds a BS in computer science from Minot State University.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got involved in the UAAccess project when Dan told me how inaccessible the software was. Accessibility and equality has always been very important to me, and I have always strived to push accessibility into as many domains as I can manage. When both Dan and I determined that existing solutions to bridge the gap between the console software and associated tools were insufficient, we set out to fill that gap with what was necessary.</p>

<h3>Dan Gililov</h3>
<p>Dan is an audio engineer, producer, musician, songwriter, artist, programmer, and advocate with a passion for accessible music production. Based in Toronto, he is deeply committed to empowering blind and visually impaired artists to fully express themselves in the studio and beyond.
Along with Carter, he has collaborated with industry leaders such as <a href="https://antarestech.com/">Antares Audio Technologies</a> (the makers of Auto-Tune®) to advocate for and implement accessibility improvements in professional music software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My journey into founding UAAccess was inspired by my own experiences navigating the countless challenges of inaccessible software and hardware. As a totally blind user of technology in a predominantly sighted world, I have firsthand knowledge of how technical barriers can stifle creative potential and put disabled individuals such as myself at a disadvantage in all walks of life. Given this, I've steadily made it my mission to break down these barriers through collaboration, innovation, and advocacy. My dream is to one day live in a world where any creator (regardless of disability) can walk into a studio and work without limitations, and I truly believe that genuine inclusion begins with education and equal access to opportunities for all.</p>
